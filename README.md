# gridrunjs

Fooling around writing a game in JS. Name and potential concept pulled from a game a friend developed in HS for the TI-83+. I guess consider this the
port the browser nobody asked for. 

Game will likely take a different shape by the time I'm "done" with it. Assuming of course this repo doesn't get abandoned in a few days :)

## What's "Done":
* Drawing board in provided dimensions (defaults to 35x35 currently)
* Movement of player around board with edge detection (use Arrow keys)
* Tallying of # of moves made by player
* Squares visited by player are marked as such


## What's Left:
* Resetting the board (currently resets coordinates and scores, but not board). Want to do something flashier than refreshing page. Potentially with some 
over-the-top CSS animations
* Adding squares the player can't access
* Figuring out less awful characters for player, board, etc.
* Everything else
